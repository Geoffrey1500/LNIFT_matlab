# LNIFT_matlab

% Demo code of the LNIFT algorithm, which is designed for multimodal image feature matching. If it is helpful for you, please cite our paper:
% Li, Jiayuan, et al. "LNIFT: Locally Normalized Image for Rotation Invariant Multimodal Feature Matching." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 60 (2022): 1-14.
% Note that the results of this Matlab code is not the same as the C++ code and the running time is much slower.
% MATLAB2021a or higher is required for the ORB keypoint detection.
